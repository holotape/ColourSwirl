# ColourSwirl

This app creates a tri-colour swirl pattern within a circle, designed such that if the circle were a one-handed clock face, the hand would always overlap two of the three colours. Each colour extends over a 240-degree arc measured from the center, ensuring that as the clock hand rotates, it spends 2/3rds of its cycle overlapping each specific colour. This design results in a continuous, overlapping colour pattern where two colours are always in conjunction with the "clock hand" at any given position.

This pattern will be used as the basis for a continuous visitor entry system where every 20 minutes a new group (colour) will enter for a forty minute period.

This will output a PNG and an SVG.
